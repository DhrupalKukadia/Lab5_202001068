-----------------------------------
Your code has been rated at 7.19/10

## Understanding of tool output:

W1401: Anomalous backslash in string: This error happens when a string contains an unusual backslash and the string constant might not have a r prefix. The r prefix instructs Python that a string is a raw string and should be treated as such, including any potential backslashes. To avoid the warning, you should change "S" to "r'S" or "S" in your code.

C0114: Missing module docstring: In the absence of a docstring, a module encounters this error. A docstring is a string that appears as the first statement in a module, class, method, or function definition, and it describes what the module, class, method, or function does. A docstring should be included at the start of your module.

C0116: Missing function or method docstring: This error occurs when a function or method does not have a docstring. You should add a docstring to the function or method.

C0115: Missing class docstring: This error occurs when a class does not have a docstring. You should add a docstring to the class.

R0914: Too many local variables (18/15): This error occurs when a function or method has too many local variables. Having too many local variables in a function or method can make the code hard to read and maintain. You should consider refactoring the code and breaking it down into smaller functions or methods.

E1101: Module '<module_name>' has no '<member_name>' member: This error occurs when Pylint is unable to find a member in a module. You should make sure that the member exists in the module and that it is spelled correctly.

R0903: Too few public methods (1/2): This error occurs when a class has too few public methods. You should add more public methods to the class.

W0613: Unused argument '<argument_name>': This error occurs when an argument is defined but not used in a function or method.

C0411: standard import "import <module_name>" should be placed before "import <module_name> as <module>" (wrong-import-order): The error is indicating a violation of a style convention for importing modules.

In Python, it is considered good practice to group import statements in a specific order:

1. First, standard library modules should be imported
2. Second, third-party modules should be imported
3. Finally, local modules should be imported
  
The error message specifically points out that the import statement for the argparse module should be placed before the import statement for the gradio module.
To resolve this error, simply move the import argparse statement to be above the import gradio as gr statement in your code.
